# ConcertAPI

## Project details:

Using BandsInTown and Google Maps API we created an application capable of the following:

1. search for an artist or a band and receive the information for all their comming events.
2. the result page will includes an image of the artis/band
3. for every event a card will be created with the following information: City, venue name, date and time.
4. every card will include 2 buttons. one for more information that will redirectb you to the event page on BandIntown that includes a link to purchass tikets. and one for direction that will redirect you to google maps with the venue location already logged.
5. At any time you can start a new search with the search bar on top of the page.
6. at the bottom you have a button to return to the home page.
